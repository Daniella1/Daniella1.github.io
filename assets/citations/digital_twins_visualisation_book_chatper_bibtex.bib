abstract="This chapter describes the potential of visualisation as a service offered by the digital twin of a cyber-physical system. Much of the value of visualisation technology comes from the ability to present stakeholders with a representation of the state and dynamics of the scyber-physical system, augmented with the results of simulation, analysis and prediction services offered by the digital twin. Forms of visualisation are briefly enumerated and compared.",
