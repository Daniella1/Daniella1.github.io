## Conference Papers

**Understanding URDF: A Survey Based on User Experience**  
*Daniella Tola* and Peter Corke
*IEEE 19th International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)*, Auckland, New Zealand, 2023  
[[PDF arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13442) [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1109/CASE56687.2023.10260660) [[Code]](https://github.com/Daniella1/urdf_survey_material) [[BibTeX]](assets/citations/ieee_urdf_survey_bibtex.bib)

> Conducted a user survey with 500+ participants on the use of URDF, its advantages, perceived challenges, and future prospectives. 
We find that the majority believe URDF will be used in the future, while many were uncertain whether a new format would take over.

## Theses

**Enabling Digitalization in Modular Robotic Systems Integration**  
*Daniella Tola*  
Ph.D. Dissertation, Aarhus University, 2023  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[📄 Thesis PDF arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02227)

Research on digitalisation of modular robotic systems integration, addressing key challenges including knowledge silos, vendor lock-in, and inefficient integration processes.
Contributions include: developing a configurator for robotic systems inspired by PC configuration, comprehensive analysis of the URDF standard (500+ survey participants, 33k+ dataset views), literature review on Digital Twins in manufacturing, and outline of how these approaches reduce integration time and costs.

<!-- Research on digitalization of modular robotic systems integration by:
- Performing a thorough analysis of the challenges in robotic systems integration, including: limited public documentation means knowledge resides within group of experts, vendor lock-in limiting composability of modular robotic devices, limited reuse of devices decreases sustainability, and unnecessarily long integration times that can be improved to reduce time and costs. 
- Developing a configurator for robotic systems, despite immense lack of defined interfaces. Inspiration drawn from configuration of personal computers.
- Comprehensive user survey on the de-facto standard robot modelling format, Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), and collection and analysis of large URDF dataset illustrating discrepancies between URDF files and also between common URDF parsers.
- Detailed literature review on Digital Twins (DTs) in manufacturing, highlighting the challenges of developing DTs of closed systems.
- Describing how each of these steps above can be used to make robotic systems integration more efficient, reducing the time and cost of the whole process. -->


**A Co-Simulation Based Approach for Developing Safety-Critical Systems**  
*Daniella Tola*  
M.Sc. Thesis, Aarhus University, 2020 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[📄 Thesis PDF](/assets/documents/Thesis_DaniellaTola_201409551.pdf) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [📊 Presentation PDF](/assets/documents/MSc_presentation.pdf)


Research on developing safety cases for complex systems operating in dynamic environments.
Proposes a process incorporating co-simulation for generating safety evidence, with guidelines on when co-simulation is appropriate.
Demonstrated through a case study on an autonomous combine harvester.

<!-- Safety-critical systems may pose a threat to their environment, potentially causing harm to or even loss of human lives. 
Such systems need to be proven as safe by regulatory bodies. However, these systems are typically very complex and operate in highly dynamic environments, meaning gathering evidence for the safety case may be a challenging task.
This thesis proposes a safety case development process which incorporates co-simulation in the creation of evidence, describing when it is suitable to use co-simulation and how the results from the simulation can be used as part of the safety evidence. The proposed process is demonstrated on a case study of an autonomous combine harvester. -->
