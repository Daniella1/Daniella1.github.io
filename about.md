# About Me

![Profile Photo](/assets/images/daniellatola_cropped.jpg){: style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; max-width: 250px; border-radius: 10px;"}

I'm a software and robotics engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that interact with the physical world. My work spans robotics systems integration, machine learning, simulation, 3D visualisation, computer vision, safety, and manufacturing.

My strength lies in systems thinking and working across disciplines to build innovative solutions.
I work methodically, breaking down complex challenges into manageable pieces while keeping the end goal in sight.

## Beyond Work

When I'm not coding or tinkering with robots, you can find me gaming with friends, at the gym or in the water (when I'm lucky, watching fish), hiking in nature, and reading broadly across philosophy, psychology, business and whatever else catches my curiosity. I'm also very passionate about teaching and mentoring.
<!-- which is why I maintain this blog and create educational content. -->

## Background

I was born in Melbourne, Australia; we moved to Iraq when I was 9 and then moved to Denmark when I was 13. At 30 I decided to move back to Australia as my mum and sister had previously moved back, and I was missing having my family nearby. Somehow, Australia always felt like _home_ to me.

My experiences have taught me to be grateful for the opportunities that I have had, especially education-wise, and have made me realise how unfair the world is, depending on where you were born or what citizenship you have. This is one of the major reasons that I love sharing knowledge, encouraging and empowering others, hoping they can utilise whatever opportunities exist and make something out of them to improve their lives.
