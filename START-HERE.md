## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to know coding to use this?**
A: No! You can edit everything using simple markdown (like writing an email). The site is pre-built and ready to go.

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: $0 if you use GitHub Pages with the free `.github.io` domain. Optionally $12/year for a custom domain.

**Q: How long does deployment take?**
A: About 10-15 minutes to go live, plus 2-3 minutes for GitHub to build your site.

**Q: Can I use this for commercial purposes?**
A: Yes! Though I'd recommend getting a custom domain for professionalism.

**Q: What if I mess something up?**
A: Don't worry! Everything is version-controlled. You can always revert changes.

**Q: Can I change the design later?**
A: Yes! You can customize colors, fonts, layouts, or even switch to a different theme.

**Q: Do I need a custom domain?**
A: No! `yourusername.github.io` is perfectly fine. You can always add a custom domain later.

**Q: How do I add more pages?**
A: Create a new `.md` file, add front matter, and add it to navigation in `_config.yml`. See README.md for details.

1. ✅ Edited `_config.yml` with YOUR information (not the placeholder)
2. ✅ Updated `index.md` to remove "[Your Name]" placeholders
3. ✅ Updated `contact.md` with YOUR contact information

These three changes take 5 minutes and ensure your site is personalized!
